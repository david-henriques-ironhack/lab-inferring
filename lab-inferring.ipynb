    "\n",
    "-The model correctly inferred sentiments, emotions, and topics when prompts were clear and specific.\n",
    "\n",
    "-For predefined topic lists, the dictionary format was accurate and easy to parse.\n",
    "\n",
    "-Emotions were well-identified and matched the tone of the reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "-In some cases, emotions inferred by GPT included general terms like \"worry\" or \"sadness,\" which were less relevant to the specific context of product reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "-For multi-task queries, responses were accurate but sometimes redundant (e.g., repeating \"negative sentiment\" when only the label was needed).\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "-The quality of results improves significantly when the prompt is specific and structured (e.g., requesting JSON or lists).\n",
    "\n",
    "-Using delimiters (like triple backticks) avoids ambiguities in the model’s understanding of the input text.\n",
    "\n",
    "-For topic detection, predefined lists streamline results and ensure relevance to targeted themes."
